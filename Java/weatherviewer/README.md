# Weather Viewer

A GUI programme to display the weather in a specified location

## About

This was a mini project during my second year of uni. The task was to "consume the BBC weather RSS feed", and we were guided to iterate upon our implementation by adding more features, such as a GUI to display the received data, weather symbols and a search bar.
