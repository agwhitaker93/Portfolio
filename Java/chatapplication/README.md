# Instant Messaging App

A GUI programme to allow multiple users to chat via the network.

## About

Pair programmed with [George Othen](https://github.com/gothentrek), this project is intended to show a proficiency in working with sockets. As we iteratively improved upon the programme, we decided to create new classes as we added new functionality. We hadn't been encouraged to use VCS, so we didn't.
